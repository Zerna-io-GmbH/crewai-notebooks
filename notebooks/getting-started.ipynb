Multimodal AI Multimodal AI goes beyond traditional single-mode data processing to encompass multiple input types, such as text, images and sound -- a step toward mimicking the human ability to process diverse sensory information. In 2024, open source pretrained AI models gain significant traction, empowering businesses to accelerate growth by combining these models with private or real-time data. This synergy enhances productivity and cost-efficiency. IBM actively contributes to open source AI models, which are exemplified by its collaboration with NASA. In 2024, generative AI might actually become useful for the regular, non-tech person, and we are going to see more people tinkering with a million little AI models. State-of-the-art AI... Which AI trends are you keeping an eye on for 2024? \"The release of ever smaller permissively-licensed multimodal models with excellent reasoning capabilities, and a concomitant wave of tinkering, hacking, and discovery.\" How do you think these trends might reshape technology, industries, or our daily routines? Generative AI has already reached its \"hobbyist\" phaseâ€”and as with computers, further progress aims to attain greater performance in smaller packages. 2023 saw an explosion of increasingly efficient foundation models with open licenses, beginning with the launch of Meta's LlaMa family of large language models (LLMs) and followed by the likes of ...\n",
